    Dear Anika,<br><br>

    Now that you're officially 31, we really need to have this conversation. I know we've been avoiding it for a while, but the question still lingers: how are we going to get the under-30 tickets for NAC shows? I say we lie, but we both know that would traumatize you. If that's the case, I might need to pick up a side job just to afford those tickets. <br><br>
    
    Joking aside (and that wasnâ€™t actually a joke, thatâ€™s a very serious discussion), Happy Birthday! Iâ€™m grateful every single day that youâ€™re in my life. Congratulations on having such an incredible year and accomplishing so many of your goals especially the big one of buying a house. <br><br>
    
    Now, we get to set some exciting goals for this year.<br><br>
    
    Love,<br>
